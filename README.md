# LegoStarWarsHTTE

A prototype of my ongoing lego game project built in Unreal Engine 5 that is based on the Star Wars: Heir to the Empire books by Timothy Zahn. This is one of my most passionate projects to date. My next goals are to have lego brick building functionality, blocking attacks, shooting and blocking blaster projectiles, and include some way for the player to be able to use the force on enemies and/or objects in the environment.
